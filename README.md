## Introduction

This is an open source library in C++ and Python to detect and model (by spline curves) the immediate left and right lane marks on the road, detect traffic signs and register lane marks and traffic signs in world coordinates, given images from a frontal view camera and a 3D LiDAR scan of the surroundings.  Some results are shown in the uploaded [thesis]{Thesis.pdf} associated with this work.
