## Introduction

This is an open source library in C++ to detect and model (by spline curves) the direction of lane marks on the road, given images from a frontal view camera and a 3D LiDAR scan of the surroundings.  This library uses the [Caffe Deep Learning Framework](caffe.berkeleyvision.org), [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), [ALGLIB](http://www.alglib.net/), [Boost](https://www.boost.org) and [PugiXML](https://pugixml.org/).
